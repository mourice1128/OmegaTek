<h1>We are Omegatek<br />Everything from Alpha to Omega!</h1>
<P><span id="video">
Omegatek can repair & maintain your PC's, Laptops, Peripherals, Networks & all things associated to those devices. No job is too small.
<br>
<br>
In today’s high-tech world, computers have become not only nice or fun to have, but an essential part of everyday life. We use computers at home, in our jobs, & every business needs computers to function. With the great need for computers, there is greater need to have them all working together. That's where Omegatek can help... Networking is a very essential part of computing. Most everyone is connected to the internet at all times though smart phones, tablets, work, or home. Networks are a huge part of businesses & even homes. It's important to keep them working, up-to-date, & secure.
<br>
<br>
There are criminals out there trying to steal your identity, credit card information, user ID’s, & passwords or whatever they can so they can live a lifestyle that many of us can only dream about, all at <em>OUR EXPENSE</em>. A lot of these criminals do this just by driving into areas that have unsecured wireless networks that they join and then steal the persons personal information. It happens all the time to people all over the world. Don't take our word for it, watch this <a href="NetSecurity.mp4" target="_blank" title="Network Security"> video.</a>
		<em>WE WILL NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU.</em>
<br>
<br>
If we lived in a perfect world computers would perform much more efficiently with fewer problems & less downtime (remember how your new PC worked out of the box). Unfortunately we <em>DO NOT</em> live in a perfect world!
<br>
<br>
Omegatek can repair, upgrade, or even custom build any PC. With technology that is constantly changing, there will always be the need to update the computer systems that we use. New technology usually means that computer will need to work better & faster than they did before. As the need for faster & more powerful computers grow, we will have no choice but to always have better computer systems.
<br>
<br>
Your current system just might need a few upgrades to become faster & more reliable. Or you might consider getting a PC built to the specs you want today, while still being adaptable for tomorrow's changes.
<br>
<br>
Never fear! Omegatek is here... to help you overcome, prevent, & repair any of the problems you may have with your systems.</span></p>
